### About
Rail Destinations is a fabric port of the [RailSwitch](https://civwiki.org/wiki/RailSwitch) plugin used on the CivMC server that allows rails to automatically switch directions based on a specified destination.


### Usage
Type `/dest destination` where `destination` is the place where you want to go. You can also input multiple destinations `/dest "destination1 destination2"` this can be useful for taking a route via specific junctions, Rail Destinations will route players towards signs that contain either destination1 or destination2.


### Setup
1. Place a sign one block above a detector rail.
2. The first line must be [destination] or [!destination] which will activate the rail if a player's destination is not on the sign.
3. The second, third and fourth lines can be destination names.
4. When a player passes over the detector rail, it will only activate and emit a redstone signal if the player has set their destination as any of the three on the sign.

### Inverters
Since intersections follow the [south-east rule](https://minecraft.wiki/w/South-east_rule) a redstone inverter will need to made to direct the rail in the other direction.
